## 🔧 Traditional Hosting Fix

If you're using a traditional web host:

2. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure SSL is properly configured for the exact domain
3. **DNS Check**: Verify domain points to the correct server IP

## 📁 Files Ready for Deployment

- ✅ `index.html` - Main website
- ✅ `.htaccess` - Security configuration  
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration

- mckenzie_friend_rights_dismissed.mp3
- reading_support_inadequate.mp3
- special_guardianship_mishandling.mp3

```bash
cd /Users/infiniteintelligence/expert-determination-site
python3 serve.py 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000 in browser
```
